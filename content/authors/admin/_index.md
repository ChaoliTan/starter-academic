Chaoli Tan is currently a Cybersecurity student at New York Institute of Technology - Vancouver campus. In NYIT, Chaoli studied a lot of Data Structures and Algorithms. He also did many security labs from Seed Labs. During the last two years, he learned some skills, such as HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and did some projects following some tutorial guides and courses. Chaoli is interested in Computer Science since he was a little child. He decided and began to grasp the interest again in Computer Science even though he has been a RF Engineer for 5 years. After graduate, he would like to work as a Software Develop Engineer.
